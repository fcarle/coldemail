**""Summarize the key points of climate change in 150 words.""**  

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions increase greenhouse gases (e.g., CO‚ÇÇ), trapping heat and causing global warming. Consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts), ecosystem disruptions, and threats to food/water security. The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels, but current trends exceed this. Mitigation requires renewable energy adoption, carbon reduction, and reforestation. Adaptation strategies (e.g., resilient infrastructure) are also critical. Individual actions (reducing waste, sustainable travel) contribute, but systemic policy changes are essential. Urgent global cooperation is needed to avert irreversible damage.

**""Summarize the key points of climate change in 150 words or less.""**  

**Answer:**  
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Key impacts include rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events (e.g., hurricanes, droughts). Greenhouse gases (CO‚ÇÇ, methane) trap heat in the atmosphere, intensifying the greenhouse effect. Consequences threaten ecosystems, food security, and human health, with vulnerable communities disproportionately affected. Mitigation strategies involve reducing emissions (renewable energy, carbon pricing) and enhancing carbon sinks (reforestation). Adaptation measures (flood defenses, resilient agriculture) are also critical. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Urgent collective action is needed to curb emissions and safeguard the planet for future generations.

**""Summarize the key points of climate change in 150 words.""**  

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions increase greenhouse gases (e.g., CO‚ÇÇ), trapping heat and causing global warming. Consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts), biodiversity loss, and disrupted ecosystems. Mitigation involves reducing emissions via renewable energy (solar, wind), reforestation, and sustainable practices. Adaptation strategies (flood defenses, drought-resistant crops) are also critical. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Individual actions (conserving energy, reducing waste) contribute to collective efforts. Urgent action is needed to avoid irreversible damage, ensuring a livable planet for future generations.

**""Summarize the key points of climate change in 150 words.""**  

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions increase greenhouse gases (e.g., CO‚ÇÇ), trapping heat and raising global temperatures. Consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts), biodiversity loss, and disrupted ecosystems. Mitigation involves reducing emissions via renewable energy (solar, wind), reforestation, and sustainable practices. Adaptation strategies (flood defenses, drought-resistant crops) are also critical. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Individual actions (conserving energy, reducing waste) contribute to collective efforts. Urgent action is needed to avoid irreversible damage, ensuring a livable planet for future generations.

**""Summarize the key points of climate change in 150 words or less.""**  

**Answer:** Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Key impacts include rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events (e.g., hurricanes, droughts). Greenhouse gases (CO‚ÇÇ, methane) trap heat, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Consequences threaten ecosystems, food security, and human health. Mitigation involves reducing emissions (renewable energy, reforestation) and adaptation strategies (flood defenses, sustainable agriculture). International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Urgent action is needed to avoid irreversible damage.

**""Summarize the key points of climate change in 150 words.""**  

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions increase greenhouse gases (e.g., CO‚ÇÇ), trapping heat and causing global warming. Consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts), biodiversity loss, and disrupted ecosystems. Mitigation involves reducing emissions via renewable energy (solar, wind), reforestation, and sustainable practices. Adaptation strategies (flood defenses, drought-resistant crops) are also critical. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Individual actions (conserving energy, reducing waste) contribute, but systemic policy changes are essential. Urgency is growing‚Äîdelaying action worsens impacts, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation, innovation, and equitable solutions to ensure a livable planet for future generations.

**""Summarize the key points of climate change in 150 words.""**  

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions increase greenhouse gases (e.g., CO‚ÇÇ), trapping heat and causing global warming. Consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts), biodiversity loss, and disrupted ecosystems. Mitigation involves reducing emissions via renewable energy (solar, wind), reforestation, and sustainable practices. Adaptation strategies (flood defenses, drought-resistant crops) are also critical. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Individual actions (conserving energy, reducing waste) contribute to collective efforts. Urgent action is needed to avoid irreversible damage, ensuring a livable planet for future generations.

**""Summarize the key points of climate change in 150 words.""**  

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions increase greenhouse gases (e.g., CO‚ÇÇ), trapping heat and causing global warming. Consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts), ecosystem disruptions, and threats to food/water security. The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels, but current efforts fall short. Mitigation requires renewable energy adoption, carbon pricing, and reforestation. Adaptation strategies (e.g., resilient infrastructure) are also critical. Individual actions (reducing waste, sustainable travel) contribute, but systemic change is essential. Delaying action worsens impacts, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities. Urgent, collective effort is needed to curb emissions and safeguard the planet.

The Beginning...

YoungPlanet started as a family project and came about as a result of living and working in London, New York, Dallas, Paris, Istanbul and Moscow and entering new communities with young children. Having travelled a bit as a family we have been inspired by the amount of children‚Äôs stuff we had been able to acquire through US style ‚Äògarage sales‚Äô and ‚Äòhand me downs‚Äô in the various places we have lived... One such item was a red fire truck coveted by our first son but also loved by his brothers - the vendor refused payment for the toy stating that it ""was more valuable to see it go to good use and to a happy child"" and this got us thinking...

YoungPlanet - What It Is...

It is a cashless platform, based on ‚Äògiving‚Äô and ‚Äòreceiving‚Äô (not necessarily concurrently) via the app and for free.

‚ÄúLive the way you want to live, but just don't waste...""

             Sir David Attenborough, Seven Worlds: One Planet

YoungPlanet combines transactional functionality with sharing economy principles. Users list unwanted items on the app, or look for items they may want or need. In the latter case they make contact with the ‚Äògiver‚Äô and exchange messages to arrange the exchange either in person, at a drop off location, or via the post or courier.

All and always given and received for free..."

**""Summarize the key points of climate change in 150 words.""**  

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions increase greenhouse gases (e.g., CO‚ÇÇ), trapping heat and causing global warming. Consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts), ecosystem disruptions, and threats to food/water security. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average, and coral reefs face bleaching due to ocean acidification. Mitigation requires reducing emissions via renewable energy (solar, wind), reforestation, and sustainable practices. The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Individual actions (e.g., energy conservation, plant-based diets) also help. Urgent global cooperation is vital to avoid irreversible damage.

Her own commitment and passion for skin and beauty care is as strong now as it was when she started in the industry 20 years ago. Louise recently embarked on another business venture, initially borne out of her own frustrations when trying to recruit staff for the salons.  Many beauty therapy graduates  have little, or no, experience of working in a salon environment and quite often the reality of beauty therapy is very different to their perception so, sadly, there are a high level of graduates that do not remain in the industry.  Rather than complain about this, in typical Louise style, she took the initiative to do something about it and The Edinburgh School of Beauty was created. The School gives students a platform to study beauty whilst gaining invaluable commercial experience in a 'real-life' salon environment.  ESB, under Louise's leadership, aims to ensure that standards in the industry are constantly improving.  At present, the industry is not regulated and Louise campaigns tirelessly to change that. Louise has been a mentor for many women, in the female-dominated beauty industry, from school leavers through to salon owners, encouraging and empowering them to be the best they can be.","Founder and Managing Director of The Zest Group Scotland.

Consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts), melting ice caps, and ecosystem disruptions.

**""Summarize the key points of climate change in 150 words.""**  

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions increase greenhouse gases (e.g., CO‚ÇÇ), trapping heat and causing global warming. Consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts), biodiversity loss, and disrupted ecosystems. Mitigation involves reducing emissions via renewable energy (solar, wind), reforestation, and sustainable practices. Adaptation strategies (flood defenses, drought-resistant crops) are also critical. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Individual actions (reducing waste, conserving energy) contribute to collective efforts. Urgent action is needed to avoid irreversible damage.

It is a simple tool for you to share that you have a hidden disability voluntarily. Simply by wearing the Sunflower, you‚Äôre just letting everyone know that you might need extra help, understanding, or just more time.

The Sunflower - always here to support you
The Hidden Disabilities Sunflower is here every day of the year to support people living with non-visible disabilities in their communities by raising awareness, training businesses and sharing stories to help create a more inclusive, understanding society.

Since its launch in 2016, businesses from every sector have been joining the global Sunflower network - ranging from retail, travel and tourism, transport, including over 280 airports - as well as railway networks, coach and bus services and ferries, education (universities, schools and colleges), healthcare, central and local government agencies to football teams, theme parks, theatres and financial institutions.

Tenants rate and review their landlord, letting agent, the rental property and the neighbourhood.

This approach makes our reviews meaningful and useful to future tenants searching for their next place to live, to letting agents to attract tenants and landlords, and to good landlords by helping them polarise themselves apart from the not-so-good.

Letting agents can build their brand, manage their online reputation, connect with their customers and build a relationship with renters before they become house buyers.

Reviews are verified by our advanced technology to improve legitimacy and trust, landlords and letting agents are also passed through verification checks to ensure site data is of a very high standard.

We're enabling the market to drive change within the private rental sector, rather than relying on regulation to do so.

Before founding Plate Up, I spent over a decade building software, pricing strategies and operational systems for some of the world‚Äôs largest law firms. I worked across global teams in finance, analytics and project delivery, focusing on how data and technology could drive better decisions, smarter processes and stronger client relationships.

At Plate Up, my role spans across: ‚Ä¢  Product & Technology - Designing the system architecture, data flows and product roadmap, ensuring we‚Äôre building for scale without compromising user experience. ‚Ä¢  Design & Customer Experience - Collaborating directly with our design and development teams to create an intuitive, seamless product that people love to use. ‚Ä¢  Customer Insights & Iteration - Constantly gathering feedback, studying behaviour and ensuring we‚Äôre evolving the platform based on real customer needs, not assumptions. ‚Ä¢  Growth & Strategy - Working with our marketing team to drive sustainable, profitable user acquisition while ensuring our B2B partnerships with retailers deliver real commercial value. ‚Ä¢  Commercial Partnerships - Leading our conversations with UK supermarkets, helping them understand how Plate Up fits into their broader digital strategy - driving bigger baskets, more frequent orders and stronger customer loyalty. I thrive at the intersection of product, data and commercial strategy, combining technical knowledge with a clear view on what drives value for customers, partners and the business itself.

We kind of hate dating apps, which is why we made one ourselves. Our goal is to help down-to-earth and ambitious people meet each other ‚Äî not only through swiping (necessary evil), but also through matchmaking, speakeasy-inspired experiences, and exclusive events (necessary good).

With a carefully curated community and on-call matchmakers, Lox Club is a place where you can finally find a partner your Jewish grandma would approve of.

*Lox Club is like a deli; it‚Äôs culturally Jewish, but you don‚Äôt have to be Jewish to enjoy it.

The app is just the tip of the iceberg. We have big dreams to create more experiences for this community. Both digital and IRL.

We strategically mentor top business leaders, CEO's and Entrepreneurs across industry to empower them to build re Imagined growth and Impact by teaching them HOW to unlock their meaning and strategically align this through all that they do.

Founded by Sara Simmonds who in 2006 whilst working as a product innovator and buyer for London based department store Harvey Nichols saw the meaningless, waste, and un sustainable practices of how we consume.

Sara felt deeply that to solve the problem of over consumption and climate change the future to consumerism was conscious. 

Sara also knew that this would need a new roadmap and began by re imagining a pair of Jeans to make them consciously and ethically putting people and planet first. Sara realised your meaning is not marketing it is everything that you do.

After creating an award winning formula to re imagine products and services to lead with meaning - The Conscious Innovator Method, Sara and the CI team today are directly impacting 1000's of people to build their legacy. The starting point for this is through our one to one and group mentorship programmes.

NOQ offers end-to-end management solutions, including payment systems, queue management, guest management, and data, aimed at increasing efficiency and revenues for events and hospitality services.

This maximizes operational efficiency and, in turn, leads to revenue growth.

Furthermore, I recognize that the success of the organization rests heavily on two vital pillars: the people within the company and the internal processes that you have established. These two elements work in tandem to drive the growth and accomplishments of the company.

Firstly, you prioritize building a strong and motivated team. You understand that the right people are essential to driving innovation, achieving objectives, and fostering a positive work culture. By carefully selecting individuals who possess the skills, values, and mindset aligning with the company's vision, you create a cohesive and high-performing workforce.

Secondly, you recognize the significance of efficient and effective internal processes. You have implemented streamlined workflows, clear roles and responsibilities, and well-defined protocols to ensure that tasks are executed smoothly and efficiently. By establishing these processes, you create a foundation that enables the entire team to work cohesively towards common objectives while minimizing redundancies and errors.

By prioritizing people and establishing robust internal processes, I have fostered an environment where team members are motivated, engaged, and enabled to perform at their best.
